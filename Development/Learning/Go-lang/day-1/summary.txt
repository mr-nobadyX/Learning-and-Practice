# ðŸŸ¢ Day 1: Getting Started with Go (Golang)

---

## ðŸš€ Why Learn Go?
Go (also called Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language created by Google.
    Itâ€™s designed for simplicity, efficiency, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for the
    system applications, cloud computing, web development, and more.

### **Key Highlights of Go:**

- **Compiled Language**: Go code compiles directly into machine code, resulting in fast execution
    without the need for a virtual machine (like Javaâ€™s JVM). This means Go binaries are tailored for the
    specific operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).
  
- **Cross-Platform**: You can build system apps, web apps, and cloud services that are easily portable across
    operating systems without major changes.

- **Minimalist Design**: Go omits features like generics (introduced in later versions), try-catch blocks,
    and inheritance (as in other OOP languages). This intentional simplicity leads to faster compilation and
    easier code maintenance. While Go doesnâ€™t use typical exception handling (`try-catch`), it provides robust
    error handling through return values and allows efficient garbage collection.

- **Object-Oriented... Sort of**: Go supports object-oriented programming concepts but takes a different approach.
    Instead of class-based inheritance, Go uses structs and interfaces to achieve flexibility and simplicity.

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Setup

1. **Download & Install Go**
   - Visit the official website [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the latest stable version for your OS.
   - Follow the installation steps as per your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Verify Installation**
   Open your terminal/command prompt and type:
   ```bash "go version"

3. **go mod init HelloWorld, its kind of "npm init" and then run the "go run file_name.go**
